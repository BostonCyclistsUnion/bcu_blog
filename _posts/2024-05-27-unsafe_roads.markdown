The picture of road safety has been mixed in the US since the COVID-19 pandemic.  Though in 2020 there was a 23% decline in the number of crashes nationally, there was a [nearly 10% increase in the number of traffic fatalities](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813563).  Worryingly, crashes in 2021 returned to near 2019 levels and fatalities have continued to increase.
Boston followed this national pattern, with a 23% decline in the number of crashes in 2020 and an 27% increase in the number of fatalities in 2020.  Similar to the national trend, 2021 was also a dangerous year in Boston, but since then numbers are trending downward.

However, the picture becomes more complicated if we separate crashes by mode.  For crashes involving cyclists and pedestrians, 2022 marked a turning point where the number of crashes began to increase.  In 2023, there was a 62% increase in the number of crashes involving cyclists and a 31% increase in the number of crashes involving pedestrians.  There have been six pedestrian fatalities observed in the data per year since 2021.

### A bleak outlook for cyclists
The data we used for this analysis had crashes through the end of March 2024.  If we limit previous years to just this first quarter of the year, we can analyze whether 2024 is shaping up to be a continuation of the problematic upward trend in crashes, particularly those involving cyclists and pedestrians.

Overall, the first quarter of 2024 has seen 17% fewer accidents than the same time in 2023.  However, if we again break the count down by the mode, we see a very troubling indication that 2024 has so far had the worst first quarter in terms of crashes involving cyclists.  We see a 70% increase in the number of crashes involving cyclists, from 33 in the first 3 months of 2023 to 56 in the first 3 months of 2024.  It is worth additional analysis why this increase has happened.  We will dive into that in future posts.

About the data
These data come from the [Boston Data Portal](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/vision-zero-crash-records).  The crashes only included incidents where emergency services were dispatched, which likely does not cover all of the crashes that happen in the city.
